## 🐉 What is Kydras?

**Kydras** is my personal Red Team project — a full offensive security platform designed to be modular, mobile-friendly, and operator-driven.

It includes:
- ✅ **[Kydras-OSINT](https://github.com/Kydras8/Kydras-OSINT)** → Quick recon toolkit
- ✅ **Kydras-Payloads** *(Coming Soon)* → Custom payloads & droppers
- ✅ **Kydras-Anonymity** *(Coming Soon)* → Stealth tools for mobile operators
- ✅ **Kydras-Playbooks** *(Coming Soon)* → Attack chains & Red Team playbooks

My goal: **real-world Red Team tools built to run anywhere — especially on mobile**.
